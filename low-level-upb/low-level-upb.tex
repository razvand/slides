\begin{frame}{Community}
  \begin{itemize}
    \pause \item OS, OS2, CNS class teams

        \item \url{http://security.cs.pub.ro/hexcellents/wiki/}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item \url{http://kernel.rosedu.org/wiki/}
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Strong Points}
  \begin{itemize}
    \pause \item enthusiastic and passionate community
    \pause \item very good bachelor studies
    \pause \item good practical abilities (hacking skills)
    \pause \item good connection to the local industry
    \pause \item very good reputation
    \pause \item expanding
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weak Spots}
  \begin{itemize}
    \pause \item to be improved master studies
    \pause \item lack of challenging (research) projects for master students
    \pause \item even more so for PhD students
    \pause \item insufficient collaboration with relevant research players
    \pause \item lack of local research skills; difficult to move from
      hacker/engineer (solving problems) to researcher/scientist (findiing
      problems)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{However \ldots}
  \begin{itemize}
    \pause \item some master classes are getting better and better (for
      example CNS)
    \pause \item there are cases where master students work at challenging
      projects and are not employed (scholarships through industry
      collaboration or research projects)
    \pause \item the number of PhD students in systems is increasing; they are
      quite good and have a better understanding of what research is (unlike
      myself ;-) )
    \pause \item Costin Raiciu has been with UPB since 2011; he's part of the
      OS team and generating good research projects
    \pause \item research skills are improving
    \pause \item good colaboration with CASED (from TU Dresden, Ahmad-Reza
      Sadeghi); Mihai Bucicoiu has been and intern there
    \pause \item DSLAB connection throuh Cristi Zamfir/George Cândea/Ștefan
      Bucur: Alex Copoț, Daniel Mahu
    \pause \item Lucian Cojocar (part of the CNS team) is a PhD student with
      Herbert Boss (VU Amsterdam)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What It Could Mean for DSLAB?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \pause \item also discussed with Cristi Zamfir
    \pause \item highly-skilled ``work-force''
    \pause \item master student internships (6 months, in the last year of
      study); may continue
      \begin{itemize}
        \item not for bachelor studies, it would be too early
      \end{itemize}
    \pause \item RA, scientific engineer positions (such as Alex Copoț)
    \pause \item PhD student internships
    \pause \item tech talks at UPB: increase awareness, improve research focus
      and skills
    \pause \item something else?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{In Short}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item highly-skilled and enthusiastic community
    \item low-level programming, kernel development, hacking, practical
      security
    \item lack of research skills, mostly hackers/engineers
    \item proper master studies still under development
    \item things are improving on the research side
    \item lots of potential, few research projects and collaborations
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
